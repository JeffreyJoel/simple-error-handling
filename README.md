# SaveEther Smart Contract

## Description

SaveEther is a simple smart contract designed to facilitate the deposit, withdrawal, and transfer of Ether between users. It utilizes Solidity's require, assert, and revert statements for error handling and ensures that transactions are processed securely and efficiently

## Features

* Deposit Ether: Users can deposit Ether into the contract, which is tracked and stored in a mapping associated with the user's address.
* Withdraw Ether: Users can withdraw their deposited Ether, provided they have sufficient savings.
* Check Savings: Users can check their current savings balance.
* Send Savings: Users can transfer their savings to another address.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy this contract, you will need to compile it using a Solidity compiler and then deploy it to the Ethereum network. [Remix]([https://pages.github.com/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)) is an amazing online tool for compiling and deploying contracts.
